# TODO:
Purchase scenarios
x Not logged in user buys items
x Non-logged in user adds items to cart then creates account then checks out
x Then re-adds items and checkouts out




# Things to do, various
Only show view cart when there are things inside it
Remove Semicolons after function declarations

Prepare media:
    - Image sizes:
      335 x 855
    - Make Sprite sheet
    - Link Media so it displays
    - Fix animating pants completely



#### Small todo items
routes|checkout.j:91 save card information if not a guest


# ONGOING QUESTIONS:

Angular:
  - What does compile do in a directive?
  - Why is link returned in directive?
  - Why does a directive have a controller

Javascript:
  - routes|checkout.js:20, set dbuser so I have db and object reference to item
  - routes|checkout.js:39, async callback
  - Should functions be defined inside of a callback (i.e. checkout.js:30, checkout)

Node:
  - checkout.js in routes. Does databaseuser need to be set, or will it persist from function calls
  - How is the callback defined in async.js (checkout.js:35)
  
EXPRESS:
  - The logger
  - The body of the request (bodyParser.json)
  - app.get('env')
  - Bin Folder


MONGODB:
  - db logs (mongodb.log)
  - db journal


YEOMAN: 
  -  .travis.yml
  -  .buildignore

BOWER:
  - Directory: Bower components
  - Bower.json


MISC:
  - Editor config
